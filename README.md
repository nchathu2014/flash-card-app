# Mobile Flash Cards - Native App

This project was bootstrapped with [expo](https://expo.io/).

Mobile Flash cards is an APP that allows you to create flashcards on your mobile device, you can create multiple Deck collections and inside those decks you will have two options, one to create cards and another to take a Quiz.

You should think of cards as "Questions", they should be created in a "Correct" or "Incorrect" format, which will allow you to choose your answer accordingly in the Quiz.

## Tech-Stack
This project was built with React Native and Redux, even tho Redux was not a requirement. It started out from scratch, functions were built to get and set data accordingly, aswell as set data thru Async-Storage on your local mobile phone, which will allow you to retrieve your data even when you close the application.


This APP is using Redux & Async-Storage, the initial data is loaded from Async-storage and set as Redux state, which allows components to get information from the STORE, also everytime actions envoked, you can verify that there are api calls that hold the Async logic as well as the Reducers to modify the state, providing those sweet refrehes, without mutating the state.
